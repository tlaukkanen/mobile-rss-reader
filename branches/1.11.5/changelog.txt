- Use m_encodingStreamReader to parse.
- Use midlet in FeatureMgr with getRssMidlet to get the RssReaderMIDlet.
- Use MiscUtil.toString to log null or the value of the equals parameter vs conditional logic.
- Use modfication of bytes only in read(...) as read() is a special case of read(...) reading only one character.

- Use OPT_TOOLS environment var for opt.tools.

- Use procIoExc from URLHandler process exception handling for IO and other exceptions including out of memory.
- Use procIoExc from URLHandler to process exception handling for IO and other exceptions including out of memory.
- Use procIoExc in URLHandler to handle the IO exception and other exceptions common with IO exception.

- Use RssFeedStore class for rssFeeds to allow synchornization for future background processing.
- Use RssItunesItemInfo for the item compares.

- Use setSettingNbr to allow easy setting of int RssReaderSettings settings using key names.
- Use singleton instead of some static vars for EncodingUtil.
- Uses smartphone for future change to using smartphone instead of itunes.

- Use super.featureMgr instead of featureMgr.
- Workaround problem where old name becomes null.

v1.11.5 Dev 16 (Dev16) (Jan 27th 2011)
- Add novice compile target.
- Build MIDP 2.0, CLDC 1.0, novice target.
- Change more static fields to instance vars for the singleton to reduce static memory used.
- Copy/put RIM jar file to ftp site.
- Don't compile code not present if small memory.
- Don't compile unneeded code for internet link version.
- Don't put novice binary into the distribution.  Only the source code will be present.
- Fix code placement for using JMUnit on a device.
- Fix conditional compile of DLOGGING code.
- Fix declaration of djmtestfree define.
- Fix location of novice.txt file.  
- Fix novice prefix by adding _ at the end.
- Fix novice property by making it true.
- Fix println statement.
- For CLDC 1.0, use this.getClass() to get the class instance to use to load KFileSelectorMgr.
- For internet link version, create only one instance of Settings using the constructor.
- For internet link version, settings is used only by SettingsForm.  Don't have it be a singleton to reduce static methods.
- Give db used and available in Kbs.
- Have about menu item to show the about/license info.
- Have future action request to end the app.
- Have jsr75Avail to determine if JSR-75 is available for MIDlet, applet or standalone.  Also, return if exists or the version number.
- Have logger object, finestLoggable, and traceLoggable for using JMUnit on a device.
- Have m_aboutCmd in FeatureMgr since it should be common for all apps.
- Have targets prepare.devopment/beta/alpha/production to make setting the properties for these stages easy.
- Have title and heading with version info in index file.
- If internet link version, don't show optional items except standard exit.
- If internet link version, have thread to initialize the settings form and then show the form.
- If m_maxItemCount has not been set, take it from the RssReaderSettings either via midlet or directly from getInstance.
- If not logging, use stdout to list stats.
- If unconditional=false is used for destroyApp, throw MIDletStateChangeException and start or continue saving.
- Increase code not compiled for internet link version.
- Keep showing license form until the user accepts it.  Otherwise, kick them out of the program.
- More only compile some portions if it is the full version.
- Need to preserve org.kablog.kgui.KFileSelectorMgr to allow loading with class.forName for optional JSR-75 code.

- Only compile Byte Order Mark code for MIDP 2.0 (i.e. not smaller memory).

- Remove parameter setting which prevents performing novice target.
- Separate out obfuscate from wtkpackage.  This allows Netebeans WTK home to obfuscate (hopefully).  Need wtkpreverify because wtkobfuscate does not preverify the result.
- Start with first link for sourceforge which while invalid, will cause prompt for internet access.  When taking http stats, don't count the first (sourceforge) link so that time to answer prompt is not counted as access time.
- Use -allowaccessmodification allow ProGuard optimization to make some methods public to use inline or other optimizations.
- Use base URL for index file pointing to the version files directory.  This allows the file to work in any directory as everything is fully qualified.
- Use getCmdAdd to create and add a command.
- Use initForm (singular) to initialize the settings form's vars/form.  
- Use initForms (plural in RssReaderMIDlet) to initialize the settings form.  This will handle showing of about/license.

- Use main display from FeatureMgr.
- Use -optimizationpasses to specify more than one (using 3 for this release) optimization passes.
- Use setSelectedIndex after initializing bookmarks to make sure selection is at the top of the list.

Device issues:

- Phone must support MP3 links, etc to play enclosures (many phones do not
  allow an MP3 to be read from a URL, but play them from the file system)

Program issues:

- While the program will not hang if there is a network problem when opening a bookmark/feed, update, update modifyed, it can hang if update all, or update modified all.  These other situations will be resolved in another release (TBD).

Development issues:
- Preferred jar/jad lacks signing authority name.
- The full version of the settings form flashes an unimportant error before showing the main screen.

General issues:
- For some emulators and devices, bookmarks are not saved.  However, saving bookmarks does work on WTK 2.5.2_01 and most phones that I have tested.
